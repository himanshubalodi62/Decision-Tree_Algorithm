# Decision-Tree_Algorithm


+ Decision trees is a tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. If an algorithm only contains conditional control statements, decision trees can model that algorithm really well.
+ Decision trees are a non-parametric, supervised learning method.
+ Decision trees are used for classification and regression tasks.
+ The diagram below shows an example of a decision tree (the dataset used is the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not):

##### A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which:

+ Each internal node represents the test on an attribute (e.g. outcome of a coin flip).

+ Each branch represents the outcome of the test.
+ Each leaf node represents a class label.
+ The paths from the root to leaf represent the classification rules.
